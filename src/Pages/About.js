        <h1>Learn, create, work and repeat.</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a Software Engineer passionate about the web, innovation, and
          music.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a background in Engineering and over a decade of experience
          working within quality systems, I have helped companies and colleagues
          by providing advice and collaborating on documentation, process
          improvements, systems automation, cutting rework and operational
          expenses, mentoring, and various other initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driven by my passions, I decided to shift my career focus and immersed
          myself in different programming languages, attended tech events, took
          online courses, and earned certifications from AWS and Microsoft. I
          also made a successful transition from my Engineering degree to a
          Bachelor's in Computer Science in 2022. üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021, I landed my first role as a Software Engineer, gained
          real-world experience with a PHP application and its ecosystem, and
          worked closely with a development team, which has helped me to get
          familiar with a full-stack app in a practical way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also play a few music instruments, have some songs on streaming
          platforms, and more recently, started making some noise in a rock and
          roll band with my trusty new friend, my Fender Jazzmaster.
        </p>
        <p>Music has also been a big part of my life ever since. üé∏</p>
